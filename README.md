# Natural-Language-Processing

This notebook explores and analyses news articles related to Bitcoin and Ethereum. We do a sentiment analysis,  word and bigram count, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis. The news articles are pulled from the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) python package and we use the most recent 100 articles of each topic to perform our analysis. We use packages from NLTK for our sentiment analysis and text processing, and spaCy and displaCY for the NER analysis.

Overall the recent news for both cryptos are slightly more positive than negative. Unsurprisingly, Russia and Ukraine are being mentioned a lot more according to the word count analysis
